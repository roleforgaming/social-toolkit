Version 0.03 By Dr. Gerald Ravenpie, 2024

First, the usual comment: do whatever you want with the text in this document, except making money or doing something illegal or immoral. By the way, that ‘illegal or immoral’ clause is just a tongue-in-cheek comment (based on a 90’s Spanish song) that probably has run its course already. So do not take it too seriously!

And second, I want to thank Martin Proctor and reddit user u/RadioactiveCarrot, whose comments (and encouraging words!) inspired me to update this document! (^ __ ^)

## GETTING STARTED

### WHAT YOU GET
**KEEPING CONTACT!** is a stand-alone system for solo roleplaying designed to be used with any other RPG ruleset as a tool for playing the relationships between your character and the NPCs. This system takes plenty of inspiration from videogames…and, to be precise, from a certain style of videogame. You’ll probably recognize it soon (hint: this add-on cover game already pointed in that direction).

The rules in this add-on default to a truly solo gameplay, as in, ‘you’re playing just one character, and the rest of the world is made of NPCs’. This system may be expanded to full parties, but even in this case you should treat one of its members as THE protagonist, and look at all these social rules from the point of view of THAT character. Thus, this character will be labeled as the ‘PC’ in this add-on, and also treated as being ‘you’. Yeah, this is one of those games (or add-ons) where ‘you’ means both ‘you, the player’ and ‘you, the character’. With a bit of luck, there shouldn’t be too much confusion because of it!

Finally, even if there’s plenty on narrative content in these rules, there’s also a mechanical component in the form of a series of procedures named ‘Actions’. These Actions are described along the text, but you can also find them compiled at the end of the document. Note that several Actions follow the (at this point, already a classic) “roll 2d6, add some trait and potential bonus or penalties and check the result: 10+ is yay!, 7-9 is meh, and 6- is d’oh!”…but beware of some variations on this theme being used here and there.

### WHAT YOU NEED
To use this system, you’ll need two 6-side dice. The text will tell you when and how many you must roll by using the expressions `ROLL(2d6)` or `ROLL(1d6)`. The former, by the way, should be read as ‘roll the two dice and add them together’; usually, and as mentioned above, you’ll have to add some bonus or penalties to get the final result.

Also, you need some way to select characters at random from a given pool at any time. The recommended option is preparing a card for each NPC (and the PC), or at least for each relevant one. You can use just pieces of paper with their names written on it, but they would be more useful if you include additional information, specially the game traits used by this add-on. When you need to select NPCs, thus, just shuffle those cards and draw as many as you need to get a logical result (i.e., discarding any result that makes no sense). As an alternative, you may only shuffle the cards of those characters who would make a logical result to begin with…but, if the character pool is big enough, all this pre-selection may take more time than the former option.

> ### WE NEED TO TALK
> There’s one aspect of social relationships, namely ‘talking with people’, which is not covered in this add-on. Maybe a bit, but simplified in the form of ‘roll two dice, check the text, this happened’. So, what could you do if you want to carry out a full Dialogue with an NPC where you can’t fully predict how that NPC will react to your words? Glad you asked! There’s another stand-alone add-on for just that, named **LET’S TALK!**, and available in this page:
> https://ucmeumm.blogspot.com/2022/11/lets-talk-standalone-npc-dialogue.html. You’ll find at the end of **KEEPING CONTACT!** some guidelines and adapted material to combine both add-ons.

> ### A BIT OF BACKGROUND
> This Social system is an stand-alone version of the one found in the **VS R** game, available in `ucmeumm.blogspot.com/p/visorpg-videogame-ish-solo-roleplaying.html`
> This 0.03 Version includes an expansion of the Faction rules, as it’s main novelty.

## ATTITUDE TRAIT(S)
The heart of the **KEEPING CONTACT!** system is **Attitude**: a trait you assign to every NPC in the game (even if, in some cases, it would be a fire-and-forget thing) that represents the nature of their relationship with you. In fact, it’s a shared trait, as this relationship works in both directions…but, just to keep your character sheet cleaner, Attitudes will be a part of THEIR character sheets instead.

In fact, ‘Attitude’ is not a single trait, but an umbrella for a series of traits, namely:
*   **ATTITUDE LEVEL**. The most basic trait, and the one you check when the single word ‘Attitude’ is mentioned in these pages. This trait has a value from +2 to -2, and describes the general nature of your mutual relationship. This also applies for those NPCs you just have met, even if in this case using the word ‘relationship’ may be overstretching it. Note that, depending on the stage of your relationship with an NPC (more on this later), these values have a different narrative nature even if they still move in the same range.
*   **APPROVAL RATING (AR)**. This trait measures how your relationship with an NPC is working in the short term. By default, ARs have a maximum value of +6 and a minimum value of -4, being all set to +0 when you start the game for the first time. While playing, your actions can change these ratings, which eventually may lead to a change in an Attitude level (what would be, in turn, a long-term change in that relationship).
*   **CONDITIONS**. An Attitude can be, at any given time, **Stressed**, **Pleased**, or both. You’ll see soon how to acquire those conditions and their effects; for now, let’s just say that getting them means a potential change in the Attitude level is on sight!

### INITIAL ATTITUDE
When you create an NPC, being it before the game starts because that NPC is expected to play a role in it, being during the game, you only need to set-up their initial **Attitude level**: all AR’s always start at +0, and Attitudes start with no conditions. You can do it by just deciding the most plausible value for that NPC and assigning it; if you want to introduce some randomness into it, just make a `ROLL(1d6)`: with a 1 the Attitude is one level lower than expected, with a 6 it’s one level higher, and with a 2-5 your hunch was on the spot. That’s all.

If the game you’re using already includes any kind of ‘reaction roll’, you can use it instead and translate the result into the more fitting Attitude level. Next chapter, you’ll find what each of this levels means in case of ‘NPCs you just find in your way’, i.e., the kind of NPC you should use those reaction rolls with!

On the other hand, to detail why an Attitude has that initial value, you can make a `ROLL(1d6)` in the First Impressions Table or the Backstory Table at the end of this document. Based on the Attitude level, these tables tell you what’s the first thing that comes to you mind when meeting a NPC for the first time (or vice versa), or why an already stablished relationship with a known NPC is at its current level.

### AR CHANGES
Your deeds and words, specially the former, will change the AR associated to an Attitude…for good or ill. This short-term changes in the relationship are based on two Actions described in this epigraph, using the words **[NPC] approves that!** and **[NPC] disapproves that!**, which you automatically resolve when you pass their requisites. Once said that, in the most extreme cases, these actions may lead to permanent changes in an Attitude level, so try to not screw things up too much if you want to keep healthy relationships!

Note that, even if some videogames allow spamming this kind of Actions for a skyrocket-y improvement in relationships, you should be a bit more restrained: several ‘pleasing a bit’ moments played in a row shouldn’t have any effect for the same NPC, for example, so there should be a cool-down time between these improvements. On the other hand, it’s easier to piss-off people beyond the limits of their patience, so you can assume that you can worsen a relationship a lot in a short period of time if you keep putting your foot in your mouth or (willingly or unwillingly) insist on being a jerk.

#### ACQUIRING CONDITIONS
When AR reaches its maximum value (+6, by default), the Attitude gets **Pleased**. If it reaches its minimum (-4, by default), it gets **Stressed**. Note that, in both cases, you do NOT reset the AR to +0. Also, even if it may sound a bit strange, the same Attitude can be **Pleased** and **Stressed** at the same time: a clear sign of an emotional rollercoaster!

#### [NPC] APPROVES THAT!
When you do something that an NPC would approve, apply one of the following cases that best fits the situation.
*   You said or did something that pleased the NPC a bit: `Roll(1d6)`.
    *   (1-3) ‘[NPC] slightly approves that!’ +0 AR.
    *   (4-6) ‘[NPC] approves that!’ +1 AR.
*   You did something that pleased the NPC a lot: `Roll(1d6)`.
    *   (1-3) ‘[NPC] approves that!’ +1 AR.
    *   (4-6) ‘[NPC] highly approves that!’ +2 AR.
*   You did the NPC a great favor: The Attitude stops being **Stressed** (if it was), turns **Pleased** (if it wasn’t), and the AR increases to its maximum value!
*   You did the NPC a once-in-a-life great favor: Erase all conditions in the Attitude, set the AR to its maximum and increase the Attitude level in one step (if it was lower than +2).

#### [NPC] DISAPPROVES THAT!
When you do something that an NPC would disapprove, apply one of the following cases that best fits the situation.
*   You said or did something that the NPC doesn’t like: `Roll(1d6)`.
    *   (1-3) ‘[NPC] slightly disapproves that!’ -0 AR.
    *   (4-6) ‘[NPC] disapproves that!’ -1 AR.
*   You did something that clearly anger, saddened, etc. the NPC: `Roll(1d6)`.
    *   (1-3) ‘[NPC] disapproves that!’ -1 AR.
    *   (4-6) ‘[NPC] highly disapproves that!’ -2 AR.
*   You caused the NPC a great harm: Erase all conditions in the Attitude, set the AR to its minimum and decrease the Attitude level in one step; if it was already at -2, the NPC turns into your bitter foe, breaking any other relationship with you.
*   The worst acts of betrayal: The Attitude level drops to -2 and the NPC turns into a bitter foe, breaking any other relationship with you.

### ATTITUDE EVOLUTION
Once in a while, you should pause to ponder how your relationships with NPCs are working. But don’t worry if you’re too busy, they’ll do it for yourself in that case! This is reflected by the **Update relationships** Action, which you automatically apply for all your relationships at a fitting time. Tradition says that a good moment for it is when your party makes camp, but it can also happen during a long travel, during a long enough time-skip, etc. Don’t overdo it, nevertheless: twice per game session should be enough.

#### UPDATE RELATIONSHIPS
When you have time to ponder how your relationships with NPCs are working, revise each NPC by following the next steps. This applies to all NPCs, not only those with you at that precise moment.
*   The Attitude is both **Stressed** and **Pleased**. Eliminate both conditions and set the AR to +0.
*   The Attitude is **Stressed**. Is this relationship worsening? Make a `ROLL(1d6)`.
    *   (1-3) Uh-uh. Eliminate the **Stressed** condition, set the AR to +0 and reduce the Attitude level in one step. In case of a Bond that already had Attitude -2, it’s automatically broken…and not in a friendly way: the NPC isn’t just **Hostile**, but also hates you.
    *   (4-6) Bullet dodged! Eliminate the **Stressed** condition, set the AR to +0.
*   The Attitude is **Pleased**. Is this relationship improving? Make a `ROLL(1d6)`.
    *   (1-3) Yay, let’s be (better) friends! Eliminate the **Pleased** condition, set the AR to +0 and raise the Attitude level in one step. If it was already at a +2 level, it keeps that way, but in some games maybe it would be time to start thinking about a romance.
    *   (4-6) Meh, feed a cat for ten years… Eliminate the **Pleased** condition and set the AR to +0 (or to +2, if it was +3 or more).

> ### LET’S GET EMOTIONAL!
> As seen, maxim up or down an AR doesn’t guarantee a change in the corresponding Attitude. In fact, the odds of this happening are just 50%...without considering the case of ending with an Attitude that’s both **Stressed** and **Pleased** (which automatically means ‘no change’). If you want Attitudes being more volatile, you can play with the ranges of results of that D6 in the **Update relationships** Action: instead of 1–3 meaning a change, you can modify it to 1-4, or (okay, this may be going too far!) to 1-5. For fairness sake, you should change both the odds of the Attitude getting better and worse, and not only one of them.

## PERSONAL QUESTS
As (another) wink to the media that inspired **KEEPING CONTACT!**, it’s assumed that relevant NPCs have a Personal Quest in addition of other quests they may offer to you. This special quest is treated as a three-stages quest with a specific reward. Namely, if you successfully complete those three stages, keeping the Attitude level (or increasing it) will be easier: the AR limits will be -5/+5 instead of the usual -4/+6. Easier to make happy, more difficult to anger!

There are, on the other hand, two risks you should consider before promptly accepting every Personal Quest you meet in your way:
*   When you’re playing one part of the Personal Quest of an NPC, they will get a bit naggy if you stop paying attention to it and focus in other matters, getting a -1 AR. Once you finish one stage of a Personal Quest, on the other hand, you’ll have time to yourself, before starting the next one.
*   Screwing up a Personal Quest is one of those things that quickly sour a relationship. At best, you’ll cause the NPC a great harm…and at worst (if you reeeeeeally screwed it up, or willingly made the quest fails) it can be seen as the worst of betrayals and turn that NPC into a sworn enemy! Note that this only happens if failing the quest was your fault: a personal quest that fails for circumstances you had no control would make the NPC angered, depressed, sad, etc., but that shouldn’t affect your relationship.

## RELATIONSHIP STAGES
There are relationships and there are relationships, y’know. Thus, even if the game world you’re playing in may have billions and billions of NPCs, only a bunch of them will be important enough to deserve keeping contact (yay, title drop!). Thus, this system divides relationships with NPCs in the three following stages:
*   **Default**. This NPC may be an acquaintance or even an ally, but it’s not very close to your heart. Or they can be your foe, or a total stranger!
*   **Bond**. You’re close to this NPC, being a friend, a mentor, or even a respected rival!
*   **Romance**. You’re in a romantic relationship with this NPC.

### DEFAULT
By default, your relationship with an NPC can be good or bad, but it’s not going to be close. So, here there’ll be the masses, but also those you know but are not your closest acquaintances. For all these NPCs, thus, the **Attitude level** will have the narrative meaning described in the next table.

#### ATTITUDE - DEFAULT
| ATTITUDE | MEANING                                                              |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **+2**   | **Friendly**: The NPC likes you.                                     |
| **+1**   | **Favorable**: The NPC thoughts well of you, even if in some cases it’s just a gut feeling. |
| **+0**   | **Neutral/Cautious**: The NPC has no reasons to like or dislike you, or has reasons for both! |
| **-1**   | **Unfavorable**: The NPC has reasons to mistrust, fear, or dislike you. |
| **-2**   | **Hostile**: The NPC despises you, but maybe not to the point to attack you on sight. |

An NPC that’s your enemy and will attack, insult, or flee as soon as they see you, on the other hand, would be an NPC with a -2 Attitude level…but one who leaves no room for being social. On the bright side, plenty of times that feeling is mutual, so you wouldn’t feel as you’re losing anything worth of your time.

### BONDS
During the game, you’ll meet different NPCs, but only a fraction will be so important to you in a positive way that you would want to forge a **Bond** with them. Thus, a Bond represents a friend, a loved one, a trusted colleague, or even a rival: what matters is that you care about your mutual relationship, so it would wise to keep it in good shape. Incidentally, this means you can’t Bond with someone you hate or even just despise: if you Bond with a rival or even an enemy, it means that at the very least you respect each other (if the relationship is in good shape, of course), and you both use that rivalry as an encouragement to give the best of yourselves.

On the other hand, even if you may want to get along with everyone, there’re some limits: you can’t have more than five Bonds at any given time. So if you want to make new ones, you must break some of the older first. But try to do it as civil as possible, okay?

#### ATTITUDE LEVELS AND BONDS
When you have a Bond with an NPC, the Attitude level still moves in the same range, but with a different and more positive meaning. As previously said, this doesn’t have a mechanical effect, but a (relevant!) narrative one.

| ATTITUDE | MEANING                                                              |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **+2**   | **Heartfelt**: You are the best friends (well, or frenemies) ever!  |
| **+1**   | **Loyal**: You have a healthy relationship with that NPC.           |
| **+0**   | **Respect**: You treat each other well, but there’s room for improvement. |
| **-1**   | **Cold**: There’s something going wrong in the relationship.         |
| **-2**   | **Toxic**: The relationship is hurting one of you, or both.          |

#### CREATING A BOND
Creating a Bond isn’t automatic: you must use the **Create a Bond** Action, which has some requisites…and a chance of turning up bad if you didn’t read the room with that NPC. But let’s not be too negative, okay?

##### CREATE BOND
During a heartfelt dialogue with an NPC with an Attitude level of +0 or better (and not **Stressed**), you can try to turn that NPC into a Bond. Make a `ROLL(2d6) + ATTITUDE LEVEL`. Also, if you have completed any stages of that NPC Personal Quest, add that amount as a bonus.
*   **10+**: The NPC accepts, and now is one of your Bonds.
*   **7 - 9**: There’s something, but it’s still too soon. The NPC asks you for more time, and you can’t try again in this Action with that NPC for a while (a few days, at the very least). When you do that, on the other hand, you get an additional +2 to the `ROLL(2d6)`.
*   **6-**: The NPC rejects, and you can’t try again this Action again with that NPC for a while (a few days, at the very least). Also, that NPC suffers -1 AR.

#### BENEFITS OF BONDS
Having Bonds gives the following benefits, which should be relevant enough to make you care about them even if only occasionally!
*   **Forgiving**. Bonds are a little more forgiving with your screw-ups, so their minimum and maximum AR values are -5 and +5 (or -6 and +4 if you also have completed their Personal Quest).
*   **Source of courage**. When you fail an important dice roll in whichever the game system you are playing with this add-on, and you can find courage, inspiration, willpower, or whatever in one of your Bonds, you can reroll and keep the best result. If the result is still a failure, on the other hand, that Bond suffers a -1 AR; if the game system you’re using includes the concept of ‘critical success’ and you get one in the reroll, that Bond will get a +1 AR. You can only use the same Bond for this once per scene, combat, or whatever, and you can’t apply more than one Bond for the same action.
*   **Sacrifice**. When you’re close to defeat (or even being killed!) and any of your Bonds is present, that NPC will take the bullet for you! At best, that means that NPC will be out of the story for a while…and, at worst, that NPC will die: assume the NPC suffers the same fate you were going to suffer. Nevertheless, you’ll be very pissed-off (or full of remorse, if your relationship with that NPC wasn’t working too well in recent times): you’ll heal up to half your usual ‘top condition’ (that would be half your maximum HPs in games that use that concept; you’ll have to reframe this a bit for systems that treat damage in other ways). Finally, only one Bond will sacrifice for you in the same combat or scene…and in case of being more than one present, the one with the higher Attitude will be the one who jumps to take that bullet.

#### BREAKING BONDS
Maybe a relationship isn’t working at all, or you both are parting ways so you can’t expect to keep contact as much as you would want. Regardless the case, when you want to break a Bond, you must use the **Break Bond** Action. You can use this Action during a conversation with that NPC, or it can just take the form of an inner monologue: it’s assumed that both of you will feel in your hearts that the bond has been broken…and its consequences.

##### BREAK BOND
When you want to break your Bond with an NPC, set the AR to +0 if it was higher than that, eliminate the **Pleased** condition if it had it, and `ROLL 2d6 + ATTITUDE LEVEL`.
*   **10+**: The NPC isn’t your Bond anymore, but the break-up is as un-stressful as it can be. You keep the Attitude level at its current value.
*   **7 - 9**: As in 10+, but there’re some hurt feelings: for a while (a few days, at the very least), you can’t improve the AR with that NPC.
*   **6-**: A bad breakup: the NPC isn’t your Bond anymore, and the Attitude is one level lower. If it already had a -2 level, then you keep that value, but the NPC will totally hate your guts!

### ROMANCE
A ‘Romance’ is the last (and optional) step in the relationship between two Bonded characters. It’s assumed it’s a relationship between the PC and an NPC, but as you’ll see soon that there are ways (also optional) of NPCs falling in love and romancing each other by themselves.

#### STARTING A ROMANCE
To start a romance with an NPC, you must use the **Start romance** Action (Actions names have been assigned following the easy way, haven’t they?). Of course, you can’t expect being able to activate it casually: as you’ll see, this Action has some important prerequisites.

##### START ROMANCE
When you want to start a romance with an NPC you have a Bond and a **Pleased** (but not **Stressed**) Attitude at a +2 level, `ROLL 2d6` (without any modifiers, by default).
*   **10+**: Love is in the air. The NPC accepts! You turn the Bond trait into a Romance one, starting at a Romantic level (+0).
*   **7-9**: There is something, but... The NPC seems receptive, but also not ready. You can’t use this Action with that NPC for a while (a few days, at the very least), but you’ll get a +2 to the roll.
*   **6-**: Too soon? The NPC rejects you. You can’t activate this Action for a while (a few days, at the very least). -2 AR.
*   **Special**: If you have just taken the **Update relationships** Action and got an increase in Attitude when it was already at +2, you can automatically try this action (if you didn’t try it recently) with a +2 to the roll.

#### ATTITUDE LEVELS AND ROMANCE
As in other cases, even if the Attitude trait still moves in a -2/+2 scale, each level has a different meaning. That’s why, even if the Attitude is falling from +2 to +0 as soon the romance starts (love is demanding!), from a narrative point of view it still implies a more intimate relationship (love is intense!).

| ATTITUDE | MEANING                                                              |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **+2**   | **True Love**: And they said this only happens in romantic novels and that kind of stuff! |
| **+1**   | **Love**: A real feeling!                                           |
| **+0**   | **Romantic**: The relationship is going well, but you now that it can go even better! |
| **-1**   | **Cold**: Someway in the road, the spark was lost.                   |
| **-2**   | **Hurtful**: The romance is near to fall apart…probably for good.    |

#### THE ROMANCE IN GAME
The narrative aspects of romance are all left to you (oh, yeah, you can bet on that!) but here there is the mechanical part:
*   When you have a romance with an NPC, that character is still treated as one of your Bonds for all effects.
*   Every time you must apply the Attitude level as a modifier to a `ROLL(2d6)`, you get a +1 bonus to that `ROLL`. That’s in addition to the Attitude level, not instead of it. Note that this mitigates that initial drop from +2 to +0 in the Attitude, and even lets you benefit from a better bonus once you bring it back to +2 (as it works as if being a +3 instead).
*   Every time you get a +X or –X to the AR of your Romantic partner, it’ll be one point better or worse, respectively (so +1 turns into a +2, -2 would be a -3, etc.). ‘+0’s results are left untouched. Love is full of extremes!
*   If a romanced NPC has a Personal Quest you haven’t completed yet, or even started, expect the NPC to ask your help for doing it. And how could you say ‘no’? Let’s hope you don’t fail! And let’s hope you don’t get derailed too much: that -1 AR when the NPC starts getting naggy would be a -2 AR instead because of the previous point!
*   When sacrificing a Bond, your partner (if present) will always be the one to take the bullet for you, regardless the Attitude level of your romance. A sad rule, but nobody said that all love stories would have a happy ending…
*   Also, nobody said that you can have only one active Romance at any given time (up to whooping five if you invest all your allowed Bonds on it!). Everything says, on the other hand, that if your partners discover it, things will turn very sour. Except if it’s an open relationship, accepted by all the involved parties, but that’s for you to decide.

#### ENDING A ROMANCE
A Romance will end if a) its level goes below -2 because of the **Update relationship** Action, b) you use the **End romance** Action described below, or c) someone reeeeeally screwed it up, as in an act of betrayal (including cheating your partner in a not-so-open relationship), failing in the Personal Quest of your partner by negligence or incompetence, etc. Note that the **End romance** Action specifies that it’s applied when you want to end the romance in good terms. If that´s not the case, check its 6- result and apply it, automatically.

##### END ROMANCE
When you want to end a romance with an NPC in good terms, set the AR to +0 if it was higher than that, eliminate the **Pleased** condition if it had it, and `ROLL(2d6) + ATTITUDE LEVEL`.
*   **10+**: It was good while it lasted. The NPC is now just a Bond, at an equivalent level of the now ended Romance.
*   **7-9**: There are hurt feelings. The NPC is now a Bond, one level lower than the now ended Romance. If it was at -2 level, instead the NPC won’t turn into a Bond, just into an NPC with a -2 Attitude (ouch!).
*   **6-**: Bad choice of words. The NPC breaks all relationships with you, turning into an NPC with a -2 Attitude (ouch, again!).

## OPTIONAL RULES
You already got the basics. So it’s time to wreck the full deal by piling-up optional rule after optional rule on them!

### SOCIAL SKILLS
As written, **KEEPING CONTACT!** ignores any social skill, merit, advantage, etc., from the game you’re using it with, as everything is based on your **Attitude level** with any given NPC, and not how good (o bad) you’re at talking your way out. Thus, if you want those traits having an effect, you can use this little optional rule: if the PC can be described as ‘convincing’, ‘charismatic’, ‘etc. (i.e., have a high level in some social skill, some social merit, etc.), you can apply it one per session to get a +1 in a `ROLL(2d6)` Action in this Add-on that could benefit for it. The bad news is that you can’t stack these bonus, even if you have different skills that would help; the good news is that you can invoke this rule after rolling the dice and checking the result, so you’re not going to waste uses in any ‘nope, still fails’ or a ‘meh, it would have been a success, anyway’ result. By the way: if you’re playing a character with low social skill levels or some social defects, they don’t need to have a mechanical effect: just role-play them, and the **[NPC] disapproves that!** Action should take care of it.

### ASKING FOR THINGS
This optional rule is the opposite of the previous one: the game you are using may lack any kind of social system (hey, more the reason for using this Add-on, then!), and you want some system to check if an NPC says ‘yes’ or ‘no’ when asked for something. This optional rule take care of that, but fair warning: all will depend on just how good or bad you get along with that NPC.

#### ASK FOR SOMETHING
When you ask an NPC for something that’s within the limits of the reasonable, and that NPC has reasons to answer anything different that ‘hahaha…no’, `ROLL 2d6 + ATTITUDE LEVEL`.
*   **10+**: The NPC accepts and will only require a small favor in return, if any.
*   **7 - 9**: The NPC accepts but will ask a similar favor in the future.
*   **6-**: The NPC rejects. Depending on the nature of the favor asked and on your relationship with that NPC this rejection may take the form of a ‘hahaha…no’, a ‘you’re asking too much!’ or a ‘I would like to do it, but I can’t’.
*   **Special - Calling in a debt**. When you use this Action with an NPC with a **Pleased** (and not **Stressed**) Attitude, you can get a +2 to the roll. You erase that condition and reset the AR to +0 if it was higher.
*   **Special - Intimidation**: When you use this Action with an NPC and you have leverage that lets you intimidate them, you can get a +2 to the roll. Their Attitude will drop one level and be **Stressed**, on the other hand. You can only use this option with NPCs you have a **Default** type Attitude, but not a **Bond**, **Romance**, etc.

### NPC-NPC INTERACTIONS
As mentioned, **KEEPING CONTACT!** puts your PC, or at the very least one PC, in the spotlight in all social interactions. Nevertheless, you can also play with the relationships between NPCs, by assigning those relationships an **Attitude** trait. Remember: this trait is applied to a relationship, not to a character, so any given pairing of NPCs would need one of this traits. This means that a game with many important NPCs requires loads of Attitude values to manage, so you should just use them just in the most relevant cases. E.g., the party members, and how they get along with each other.

Relationships between NPCs can change during the game too, so that means taking note of their respective AR’s, if they’re **Stressed** or **Pleased**, etc. The **[NPC] approves that!** and **[NPC] disapproves that!** Actions, thus, would apply and change their AR when one NPC does something that may please or anger another, even if you’re not involved at all. You must check if their Attitudes change every time you use the **Update relationships** Action. Once again, don’t panic: NPC-NPC interactions are less frequent, so there’re less chances of them getting the **Pleased** or **Stressed** conditions…and thus, of being affected by the **Update relationships** Action.

Finally, during the game, there may be moments when the members of your party (or, in general, two important NPCs) socialize with each other. To represent it, there’re three additional Actions, concerning those moments where two NPCs have a hearty conversation, a heated argument or just a talk. To select which NPCs are involved in that Action, you can use the method that was described in the first chapter of this Add-on (shuffling and dealing character cards). By the way, nobody says that you can’t include YOU card as a possible result, and end up being involved in one of these Actions (they’re not as ‘NPC-exclusive’ as they seem, after all). Come on, do it. What could possibly go wrong?

#### A HEATED ARGUMENT
When two characters have a heated argument, `ROLL(2d6) + ATTITUDE LEVEL`
*   **12+**: Why were they arguing, now? It seems that was just a silly misunderstanding and now they can laugh about it! +1 AR.
*   **10+**: The characters agree to disagree, which is not a bad result at all.
*   **7 – 9**: Officially, there’re no grudges. In practice, make a `ROLL(1d6)`
    *   (1-2) The argument has been postponed, not just forgotten. They’ll get a -1 penalty to their next Attitude roll related to **A moment of intimacy**, **A heated argument** or **A polite conversation**.
    *   (3-4) There’re some hidden grudges. -1 AR.
    *   (5-6) Sometimes, theory and practice go hand in hand, and this’s one of those times! There are no further consequences.
*   **6-**: At some moment, the argument escalates from ‘heated’ to ‘ugly’. Make a `ROLL(1d6)`
    *   (1-2) Luckily, they stop before there’s too much damage. -2 AR.
    *   (3-4) Some words that shouldn’t be spoken are…well, guess it. The Attitude trait is **Stressed**; if already **Stressed**, make an immediate **Update relationship** Action.
    *   (5-6) There’re plenty of grudges and hurt feelings! Both characters suffer a -2 penalty to Attitude in their next Attitude roll related to **A moment of intimacy**, **A heated argument** or **A polite conversation**.

#### A MOMENT OF INTIMACY
When two characters have a moment of intimacy (which includes just having a hearty conversation), `ROLL(2d6) + ATTITUDE LEVEL`.
*   **12+**: If one of the following cases applies, follow it. If not, go to the 10+ result.
    *   If the characters are in a romance, they have a special moment. +3 AR (which includes the +1 bonus for being in a romance).
    *   If both have already a crush on each other, they may automatically start a romance if they’re both NPCs!
    *   If the Attitude level is +2, one of the characters acquires a crush on the other. If already had a crush, that NPC may even use the **Start romance** action, just now!
*   **10+**: The characters both a) connect with each other (+1 AR), and b) get a +1 bonus to their next Attitude roll related to **A moment of intimacy**, **A heated argument** or **A polite conversation**.
*   **7 – 9**: As 10+, but only one of the two results, randomly selected.
*   **6-**: Something happens that spoils the moment. Make a `ROLL(1d6)`
    *   (1-2): Another character of the party accidently interrupts the moment. -1 penalty to the next Attitude roll for that character related to **A moment of intimacy**, **A heated argument** or **A polite conversation** with each of the other two characters.
    *   (3-4) One of the two characters says the wrong words or does the wrong thing. -1 AR.
    *   (5-6) Unexpected circumstances make the moment ends, but without any ill effect.

#### A POLITE CONVERSATION
When two characters have a polite conversation, `ROLL(2d6) + ATTITUDE LEVEL`.
*   **10+**: The characters found common ground that improves their relationship. +1 AR.
*   **7 – 9**: An interesting conversation, and characters take note. They’ll get a +1 bonus to their next Attitude roll related to **A moment of intimacy**, **A heated argument** or **A polite conversation**.
*   **6-**: At some moment, the ‘politeness’ is left aside. Make a `ROLL(1d6)`
    *   (1-2) Nah, all is good. Let’s agree to disagree.
    *   (3-4) Officially, there’re no grudges. In practice, it’s a -1 penalty to their next Attitude roll related to **A moment of intimacy**, **A heated argument** or **A polite conversation**
    *   (5-6) Some hurtful words are used at some moment. -1 AR.

> ### JUST PERSONAL
> The bonuses and penalties to Attitude rolls from these Actions only apply for interactions between the two characters who were involved in them. There is one exception: the case of the ‘unwitting party-popper who ruins the mood’, specifically mentioned in the text. Also, all those bonus and penalties apply to just one roll; i.e., for the first among the **A moment of intimacy**, **A heated argument**, or **A polite conversation** Actions that happens between those characters, not to each one of them.

### LET’S TALK! PORTING
If you reach the rightmost column (or started there) and you should shift one more to the right, roll two d10s and use the highest result. If you should shift two more, right three d10s instead. Conversely, if you’re at the leftmost column and still have to shift one or two columns to the left, roll two or three d10s, respectively, and keep the lowest result.

## FACTIONS
In some games, you shouldn’t only care about how you deal with other people: you must also watch how you deal with big groups of people. As in ‘billions and billions’, from a certain point of view and in certain genres. Enter the **Factions** concept, being them organizations that play a relevant role in the game world. Or, at least, in that part of the world you’ll be roaming through.

This section of optional rules (whose length deserved a full chapter) reframes the **Attitude** trait to make it represent your relationship with a Faction at different levels: as a mere outsider, as a full-member, or as it’s leader. Note that this Attitude receives different names depending of that level (**Reputation**, **Status**, and **Leadership**), but it’s still an Attitude, so you apply it as such when rolling Actions that call for this trait.

Additionally, this section also includes new member Actions to represent the interactions between Factions while you watch the show eating popcorns so if that interaction cause a ruckus that catches you in the crossfire…and even less if your Factions is one of those being involved!

### OUTSIDER
At its lower level (i.e., you’re seen as an outsider), your interaction with a Faction is based on your **Reputation**. This way, as NPCs, a Faction has an **Attitude level** describing that Reputation, and an AR (from -4 to +6).

#### REPUTATION
| ATTITUDE | MEANING                                                              |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **+2**   | **Ally**: The Faction consider you as ‘one of them’, even if not an official member. |
| **+1**   | **Trusted**: The Faction likes to work with you, as they see you as dependable. |
| **+0**   | **Neutral**: The Faction doesn’t have reasons to trust or distrust you, so it’ll always be a ‘just business’ thing with them. |
| **-1**   | **Distrusted**: The Faction doesn’t like working with you too much, due to past offenses. |
| **-2**   | **Despised**: The Faction thinks that you’re scum, and only the direst of the circumstances (or the biggest pay to look away) could compensate that. |

#### REPUTATION EVOLUTION
A **Reputation** works the same way than in the case of NPCs: it may be **Stressed** or **Pleased**, and it’s subjected to the **Update relationships** Action. Of course, making a big heap of people happy is more difficult than doing the same with just one, so you should do double-work (at the very least!) to deserve an increase of AR with them.

#### PERSONAL Vs. PROFESSIONAL
> When dealing with an NPC from a Faction in official matters, you should use your **Reputation** with that Faction instead of the **Attitude** of that NPC. In not-so-official matters, NPCs usually apply their Attitudes instead. There’re cases when this may not apply (not always to your benefit), if it fits the tone of the story, as in…
> *   **Case I**. When dealing with official matters with an honest-cop NPC who appreciates you despite your vigilante persona (Attitude +1), but who is member of a thoroughly corrupted Police Department with a very different opinion (Reputation -2), you probably could use the former value instead of the latter. Just don’t put that NPC between a rock and a hard place, okay?
> *   **Case II**. When dealing on a personal matter with your childhood-friend NPC (Attitude +2), but who’s also a member on the opposite side of a war (Reputation -2), you may find yourself being betrayed one day because that NPC is pressured to put duty before feelings.

#### BEING HUNTED
When the **Update relationships** Action asks you to reduce a **Reputation** when it’s already -2, when you really screwed it up (or are framed of doing it!) and the **[NPC] disapproves that!** Action tells you that the Faction is now your enemy, things turn ugly: the **Reputation** stands at -2, but you are now seen as an enemy of that Faction, being actively hunted by it!

This sounds quite ominous, but from an in-game point of view it only means that you should add that Faction to your list of enemies. Expect many ‘random’ encounters being actually-not-random-at-all in the future, with the Faction being behind them. On the bright side and based on the ‘enemy of my enemy’ principle, you can expect assistance from those Factions that are butting heads with the one that wants you dead…for a fair pay, at least. Of course, you may end up pissing off both sides of the conflict, so in this case maybe you should try to incite them to destroy each other? Without destroying the game world in the process? If nothing else, that would be a cool example of ‘emergent narrative’, wouldn’t it?

### MEMBER
When you create a **Bond** with a Faction, which follows the same process that the case of NPCs, you turn into a full member. Thus, the Attitude is now a measurement of your **Status** in that Faction, as resumed in the following table.

#### STATUS
| ATTITUDE | MEANING                                                              |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **+2**   | **Paragon**: The Faction use you as an example to the other members! |
| **+1**   | **Valued member**: The Faction is satisfied with your work.         |
| **+0**   | **Under test**: You still must prove yourself, or maybe you’re a case of ‘sometimes an asset, sometimes a hindrance’. |
| **-1**   | **Lacking**: The Faction finds your performance quite underwhelming. |
| **-2**   | **Foot out the door**: At this point, the Faction is seriously thinking about kicking you out. |

**Status** stills can be improved (or worsened!) as any other Attitude: expect your higher-ups being very strict and tight with their rewards and compliments! To make this point home, you must reduce the **Status** with the Faction to +0 when you make a **Bond** with it even if your **Reputation** was higher than that: you could be a valuable outsider, but now you must prove you’re also a valuable insider!

On the plus side, **Status** has better AR limits (as any other Bond) and may give you courage in your darkest hours. On the other hand, you can’t sacrifice a full Faction during a conflict just to save your skin, so forget about that! And it goes without saying that you can’t start a romance with a whole Faction; don’t be a pervy, gosh!

#### LEAVING A FACTION
Once you join a Faction, you must keep your **Bond** with it healthy because anything that breaks that Bond also ends your relationship with it. This includes the cases where the **Update relationships** or **[NPC] disapproves that!** Actions tell you so, but also when you use the **Break Bond** Action with a Faction that see abandoning ship as a treason (which means that you shouldn’t even roll the dice for that Action, and just use its 6- result).

Thus, the only way of leaving a Faction in good terms is a successful use the **Break Bond** Action with a Faction that allows it to begin with. Anything else means that your former Faction sees you as an enemy, and you’ll be hunted by it as explained in the **Outsider** case.

### LEADER
Why be just a piece in the game when you can be the player? Being by merit, by lineage, or by-this-axe, you may end up as the leader of a whole Faction. In that case, the Attitude trait will change its meaning once again to represent your **Leadership**. You are allowed to change this label to ‘Mandate of Heaven’ if your Faction represents a Realm; encouraged, even!

#### LEADERSHIP
| ATTITUDE | MEANING                                                              |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **+2**   | **Veneration**: People sees you as the best leader they could get!  |
| **+1**   | **Satisfaction**: People sees you as a worthy leader.                |
| **+0**   | **Acceptance**: Yep, you saved our Realm from a BBEG, but what have you done for us lately? |
| **-1**   | **Lacking**: There’s some disquiet among your people.               |
| **-2**   | **Revolt**: Would-be usurpers are talking, and people is listening.  |

#### CLIMBING TO THE TOP
If you climb-up the ranks to this leadership positions, you start with **Leadership** of +0 if your **Status** was positive (as in you’ll be still untested as a leader), or -1 otherwise (as you weren’t the most appreciated member to begin with). Note that the latter may turn into an actual improvement, if your **Status** was -2: it can be assumed that you have taken care of your loudest detractors. Ahem.

If you just skip the middle-person and achieves a leadership position because reasons, the starting **Leadership** will be +0 if you were mostly accepted, or -1 if you fought your way up (metaphorically or literally).

#### STANDING ON TOP
Did you think that keeping people happy when you were just a mere member of a Faction was tricky? Ha, you have seen nothing yet! Now, you must keep everyone happy, because everyone will be looking in your direction when troubles knock the door. And sometimes when things go well.

Also…nope, even if you’re its leader, you still can’t start a **Romance** with your Faction. Seriously, that’s a pretty screwed-up vision of leadership!

#### HOW THE MIGHTY FALL
When the **Update Relationships** or **[NPC] disapproves that!** Action prompts you to drop your **Leadership** when it’s already -2 or tell you that the relationship is broken, this means instant rebellion. However, unlike other cases, you still are the Leader and keep **Leadership** at -2. Problem is that you won’t be able to improve until…
*   you’re deposed. This breaks your **Bond** with the Faction, turns you into an outsider with **Reputation** -2 and the Faction is your enemy.
*   you step down. This breaks your **Bond** with the Faction and turns you into an outsider with **Reputation** -2, but at least the Faction isn’t actively hunting you.
*   somehow you manage to earn the right to raise your **Leadership**. Instead, you keep it at -2 and the rebellion ends.

On the other hand, if you use your **Break Bond** Action when you’re not in such a dire situation, you choose your new relationship type with the Faction (**Status** if you’re still a member, or **Reputation** if you leave it). You don’t roll the dice, however, but assume an automatic 10+ result in that Action. This lets you even totally leave a Faction that normally wouldn’t allow deserters, as it would see as a retirement.

### FACTION QUESTS
Factions offer you the chance to play a **Faction Quest**, following the same mechanism as the **Personal Quests** of NPCs. That means that fulfilling it will improve the AR limits as usual (so, from that point, they would be -5/+5, or -6/+4 if you have a **Bond** with the Faction). It’s a risky business, nevertheless, because screwing-up during a **Faction Quest** means than there’s now a full organization who’s angry with you, instead of just one person. Of course, a great power come with great responsibility, so every time you achieve a higher level of relationship with a Faction (outsider to member, and member to leader) the maximum and minimum AR values will reset to their defaults, and there’ll be another Faction plot with higher stakes available. Regarding that…
*   As you must make a Faction one of your Bonds if you want to be one of its members, it means you have to finish at least part of its Faction Quest.
*   Once you’re a leader, there’s no higher place to go, but you still may find interesting improving those -5/+5 limits[^1] to -6/+4.

[^1]: Note that, by definition, these limits can’t be -4/+6, because you’ll always have a Bond with any Faction you’re a member or a leader!

### ONLOOKER
If you use this rule, any two Factions will share an Attitude trait that works as any other: it has an associated AR, it can be stressed or pleased, and it can change due to the **Update relationships** Action. Of course, increasing the number of Factions makes the number of potential pairings explode, so you only should care about the most important ones, and consider the rest mostly static (as in, just give them an Attitude level that sounds reasonable, and call it a day).

#### FACTIONS AND ATTITUDE
You don’t need too many new rules for playing this Faction - Faction interactions: mostly reskinning of already known ones. Thus, to start, here there is a table with the narrative meaning of the Attitude value between two Factions, in this case labeled as **Ties**.

| ATTITUDE | MEANING                                                              |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **+2**   | **Allies**: The Factions have strong ties, so upsetting one is upsetting the other! |
| **+1**   | **Cordiality**: The Factions are used to work together and trust each other. Kinda. |
| **+0**   | **Just business**: The Factions are polite enough to work together when required, and mostly ignore each other in other case. |
| **-1**   | **Animosity**: The Factions rarely see eye to eye…if ever.           |
| **-2**   | **Enemies**: The two Factions are this close to go to each other’s throat…if they’re not doing that already! |

Factions can’t make Bonds with each other as the latter are a very personal matter among individuals, not institutions. Also, alliances among organizations than are even fickler than those among persons, so they’re represented by that +2 Attitude value…which, as always, must be carefully managed if you don’t want to see it fall.

#### CHOOSING SIDES
Getting along with different Factions can be quite problematic when they hate their respective guts. To reflect this, you can apply this rule: every time you use the **[NPC] approves that!** with one Faction because you did something that helped them, you also must do an equivalent **[NPC] disapproves that!** at the same level with any Faction that has a **Ties** -2 with the former. For fairness’s sake, the penalty to AR you finally get for the latter shouldn’t be worse that the bonus you get for the former. Also, if you increase your Attitude level with one Faction, you reduce it with any other they have **Ties** -2.

Note that, even if in the future those Factions can improve their **Ties** to -1 (or even better), you don’t retroactively erase all those penalties you suffered. You were working for the wrong side when it mattered…or at least that’s the point of view of Factions (Factions can be very petty, sometimes!).

### FACTION ACTIONS
With respect to mechanical ways of represent the interactions between two Factions, here there are three Actions to cover them. They’re mostly re-skinnings of the **A moment of intimacy**, **A heated argument** and **A polite conversation** Actions. As mentioned, all these Actions are based on a `ROLL(2d6) + ATTITUDE`…which, in this case, is synomym of `ROLL(2d6) + TIES`.

[Yes, all mentions to romance have been nixed: Factions can’t romance each other. You probably were seeing that from a mile off.]

Finally, these Actions consider the case of two Factions involved in the interaction, and how it works in the end. When one Faction does something that may please or anger another and it’s fait accompli, you use the **[NPC] approves/disapproves that!** instead.

#### BUTTING HEADS
When there’s some conflict of interest between two Factions, `ROLL(2d6) + ATTITUDE`.
*   **12+**: Somehow, some one finds the way to make it everything work for everybody! +1 AR.
*   **10+**: After some chest-pounding, the Factions reach a compromise.
*   **7 - 9**: The compromise tries to please everyone, but please no one. Make a `ROLL(1d6)`
    *   (1-2) The argument has been postponed, not just forgotten. They’ll get a -1 penalty to their next Attitude roll related to **For the mutual benefit**, **Entente cordiale** and **Butting heads** Actions.
    *   (3-4) Everyone is taking note of this. -1 AR.
    *   (5-6) Despite some frowning, everyone agrees in not rocking the boat. No consequences.
*   **6-**: Okay, this is escalating. Make a `ROLL(1d6)`
    *   (1-2) Some lines in the sand are drawn. -2 AR.
    *   (3-4) Sabre-rattling time! The Attitude trait is **Stressed**; if already **Stressed**, make an immediate **Update relationship** Action.
    *   (5-6) The ugliness may be contagious. As (3-4), both Factions get a -1 penalty to their next Attitude roll related to **For the mutual benefit**, **Entente cordiale** and **Butting heads** Actions…even if it’s with a Faction that was not involved in all the mess!

#### ENTENTE CORDIALE
When two Factions have the chance to interact together more by chance that by planning, `ROLL(2d6) + ATTITUDE`.
*   **10+**: The Factions found common ground that improves their relationship. +1 AR.
*   **7 – 9**: An interesting conversation, and Factions take note. They’ll get a +1 bonus to their next Attitude roll related to **For the mutual benefit**, **Entente cordiale** and **Butting heads** Actions.
*   **6-**: Uh-uh, things didn’t go well. Make a `ROLL(1d6)`
    *   (1-2) Yeah, let’s not talk about this again. No consequences.
    *   (3-4) Officially, it’s all smiles and pats on the back. In practice, -1 penalty to their next Attitude roll related to **For the mutual benefit**, **Entente cordiale** and **Butting heads** Actions.
    *   (5-6) Relationship is strained. -1 AR.

#### FOR THE MUTUAL BENEFIT
When two Factions have a chance to work together in a relevant enterprise, or start conversations to strengthen ties, `ROLL(2d6) + ATTITUDE`.
*   **10+**: Great experience. Will buy again. The Factions both a) strengthen ties (+1 AR), and b) get a +1 bonus to their next Attitude roll related to **For the mutual benefit**, **Entente cordiale** and **Butting heads** Actions.
*   **7 – 9**: An enriching experience. As 10+, but only one of the two results, randomly chosen.
*   **6-**: Unexpected turn of events. Make a `ROLL(1d6)`
    *   (1-2) The enterprise or conversations ends up being a fiasco. -1 AR.
    *   (3-4) Something urgent catches the attention of one of the Factions (or maybe both); time to roll for some random and interesting event in your system of choice!
    *   (5-6) Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. There’re no further consequences.

## COMPILED ACTIONS & TABLES
*(Note: These actions are compiled from their first appearance in the document for quick reference.)*

### A HEATED ARGUMENT

*   **7 - 9**: The NPC accepts but will ask a similar favor in the future.
*   **6-**: The NPC rejects. Depending on the nature of the favor asked and on your relationship with that NPC this rejection may take the form of a ‘hahaha…no’, a ‘you’re asking too much!’ or a ‘I would like to do it, but I can’t’.
*   **Special - Calling in a debt**. When you use this Action with an NPC with a **Pleased** (and not **Stressed**) Attitude, you can get a +2 to the roll. You erase that condition and reset the AR to +0 if it was higher.
*   **Special - Intimidation**: When you use this Action with an NPC and you have leverage that lets you intimidate they, you can get a +2 to the roll. Their Attitude will drop one level and be **Stressed**, on the other hand. You can’t use this option with (including romantic partners).

### BREAK BOND
When you want to break your Bond with an NPC, set the AR to +0 if it was higher than that, eliminate the **Pleased** condition if it had it, and `ROLL 2d6 + ATTITUDE LEVEL`.
*   **10+**: The NPC isn’t your Bond anymore, but the break-up is as un-stressful as it can be. You keep the Attitude level at its current value.
*   **7 - 9**: As in 10+, but there’re some hurt feelings: for a while (a few days, at the very least), you can’t improve the AR with that NPC.
*   **6-**: A bad breakup: the NPC isn’t your Bond anymore, and the Attitude is one level lower. If it already had a -2 level, then you keep that value, but the NPC will totally hate your guts!

### BUTTING HEADS
When there’s some conflict of interest between two Factions, `ROLL(2d6) + ATTITUDE`.
*   **12+**: Somehow, some one finds the way to make it everything work for everybody! +1 AR.
*   **10+**: After some chest-pounding, the Factions reach a compromise.
*   **7 - 9**: The compromise tries to please everyone, but please no one. Make a `ROLL(1d6)`
    *   (1-2) The argument has been postponed, not just forgotten. They’ll get a -1 penalty to their next Attitude roll related to **For the mutual benefit**, **Entente cordiale** and **Butting heads** Actions.
    *   (3-4) Everyone is taking note of this. -1 AR.

    *   (1-2) Some lines in the sand are drawn. -2 AR.
    *   (3-4) Sabre-rattling time! The Attitude trait is **Stressed**; if already **Stressed**, make an immediate **Update relationship** Action.
    *   (5-6) The ugliness may be contagious. As (3-4), both Factions get a -1 penalty to their next Attitude roll related to **For the mutual benefit**, **Entente cordiale** and **Butting heads** Actions…even if it’s with a Faction that was not involved in all the mess!

### CREATE BOND
During a heartfelt dialogue with an NPC with an Attitude level of +0 or better (and not **Stressed**), you can try to turn that NPC into a Bond. Make a `ROLL(2d6) + ATTITUDE LEVEL`. Also, if you have completed any stages of that NPC Personal Quest, add that amount as a bonus.
*   **10+**: The NPC accepts, and now is one of your Bonds.
*   **7 - 9**: There’s something, but it’s still too soon. The NPC asks you for more time, and you can’t try again in this Action with that NPC for a while (a few days, at the very least). When you do that, on the other hand, you get an additional +2 to the `ROLL(2d6)`.
*   **6-**: The NPC rejects, and you can’t try again this Action again with that NPC for a while (a few days, at the very least). Also, that NPC suffers -1 AR.

### END ROMANCE
When you want to end a romance with an NPC in good terms, set the AR to +0 if it was higher than that, eliminate the **Pleased** condition if it had it, and `ROLL(2d6) + ATTITUDE LEVEL`.
*   **10+**: It was good while it lasted. The NPC is now just a Bond, at an equivalent level of the now ended Romance.
*   **7-9**: There are hurt feelings. The NPC is now a Bond, one level lower than the now ended Romance. If it was at -2 level, instead the NPC won’t turn into a Bond, just into an NPC with a -2 Attitude (ouch!).
*   **6-**: Bad choice of words. The NPC breaks all relationships with you, turning into an NPC with a -2 Attitude (ouch, again!).

### ENTENTE CORDIALE
When two Factions have the chance to interact together more by chance that by planning, `ROLL(2d6) + ATTITUDE`.
*   **10+**: The Factions found common ground that improves their relationship. +1 AR.
*   **7 – 9**: An interesting conversation, and Factions take note. They’ll get a +1 bonus to their next Attitude roll related to **For the mutual benefit**, **Entente cordiale** and **Butting heads** Actions.
*   **6-**: Uh-uh, things didn’t go well. Make a `ROLL(1d6)`
    *   (1-2) Yeah, let’s not talk about this again. No consequences.
    *   (3-4) Officially, it’s all smiles and pats on the back. In practice, -1 penalty to their next Attitude roll related to **For the mutual benefit**, **Entente cordiale** and **Butting heads** Actions.
    *   (5-6) Relationship is strained. -1 AR.

### FOR THE MUTUAL BENEFIT
When two Factions have a chance to work together in a relevant enterprise, or start conversations to strengthen ties, `ROLL(2d6) + ATTITUDE`.
*   **10+**: Great experience. Will buy again. The Factions both a) strengthen ties (+1 AR), and b) get a +1 bonus to their next Attitude roll related to **For the mutual benefit**, **Entente cordiale** and **Butting heads** Actions.
*   **7 – 9**: An enriching experience. As 10+, but only one of the two results, randomly chosen.
*   **6-**: Unexpected turn of events. Make a `ROLL(1d6)`
    *   (1-2) The enterprise or conversations ends up being a fiasco. -1 AR.
    *   (3-4) Something urgent catches the attention of one of the Factions (or maybe both); time to roll for some random and interesting event in your system of choice!
    *   (5-6) Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. There’re no further consequences.

### [NPC] APPROVES THAT!
When you do something that an NPC would approve, apply one of the following cases that best fits the situation.
*   You said or did something that pleased the NPC a bit: `Roll(1d6)`.
    *   (1-3) ‘[NPC] slightly approves that!’ +0 AR.
    *   (4-6) ‘[NPC] approves that!’ +1 AR.
*   You did something that pleased the NPC a lot: `Roll(1d6)`.
    *   (1-3) ‘[NPC] approves that!’ +1 AR.
    *   (4-6) ‘[NPC] highly approves that!’ +2 AR.
*   You did the NPC a great favor: The Attitude stops being **Stressed** (if it was), turns **Pleased** (if it wasn’t), and the AR increases to its maximum value!
*   You did the NPC a once-in-a-life great favor: Erase all conditions in the Attitude, set the AR to its maximum and increase the Attitude level in one step (if it was lower than +2).

### [NPC] DISAPPROVES THAT!
When you do something that an NPC would disapprove, apply one of the following cases that best fits the situation.
*   You said or did something that the NPC doesn’t like: `Roll(1d6)`.
    *   (1-3) ‘[NPC] slightly disapproves that!’ -0 AR.
    *   (4-6) ‘[NPC] disapproves that!’ -1 AR.
*   You did something that clearly anger, saddened, etc. the NPC: `Roll(1d6)`.
    *   (1-3) ‘[NPC] disapproves that!’ -1 AR.
    *   (4-6) ‘[NPC] highly disapproves that!’ -2 AR.
*   You caused the NPC a great harm: Erase all conditions in the Attitude, set the AR to its minimum and decrease the Attitude level in one step; if it was already at -2, the NPC turns into your bitter foe, breaking any other relationship with you.
*   The worst acts of betrayal: The Attitude level drops to -2 and the NPC turns into a bitter foe, breaking any other relationship with you.

### START ROMANCE
When you want to start a romance with an NPC you have a Bond and a **Pleased** (but not **Stressed**) Attitude at a +2 level, `ROLL 2d6` (without any modifiers, by default).
*   **10+**: Love is in the air. The NPC accepts! You turn the Bond trait into a Romance one, starting at a Romantic level (+0).
*   **7-9**: There is something, but... The NPC seems receptive, but also not ready. You can’t use this Action with that NPC for a while (a few days, at the very least), but you’ll get a +2 to the roll.
*   **6-**: Too soon? The NPC rejects you. You can’t activate this Action for a while (a few days, at the very least). -2 AR.
*   **Special**: If you have just taken the **Update relationships** Action and got an increase in Attitude when it was already at +2, you can automatically try this action (if you didn’t try it recently) with a +2 to the roll.

### UPDATE RELATIONSHIPS
When you have time to ponder how your relationships with NPCs are working, revise each NPC by following the next steps. This applies to all NPCs, not only those with you at that precise moment.
*   The Attitude is both **Stressed** and **Pleased**. Eliminate both conditions and set the AR to +0.
*   The Attitude is **Stressed**. Is this relationship worsening? Make a `ROLL(1d6)`.
    *   (1-3) Uh-uh. Eliminate the **Stressed** condition, set the AR to +0 and reduce the Attitude level in one step. In case of a Bond that already had Attitude -2, it’s automatically broken…and not in a friendly way: the NPC isn’t just **Hostile**, but also hates you.
    *   (4-6) Bullet dodged! Eliminate the **Stressed** condition, set the AR to +0.
*   The Attitude is **Pleased**. Is this relationship improving? Make a `ROLL(1d6)`.
    *   (1-3) Yay, let’s be (better) friends! Eliminate the **Pleased** condition, set the AR to +0 and raise the Attitude level in one step. If it was already at a +2 level, it keeps that way, but in some games maybe it would be time to start thinking about a romance.
    *   (4-6) Meh, feed a cat for ten years… Eliminate the **Pleased** condition and set the AR to +0 (or to +2, if it was +3 or more).
